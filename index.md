### How Did I choose my PLEx Project? Why?

My idea for my PLEx project came originated from something in the back of my mind. I always wanted to make a computer program, and have something to show for it. So, I thought to myself: _‘Why don’t I base my PLEx project around computers?’_  
And that is exactly what I did. 

  My idea was of interest to me, and it was the only one that I had for this experience, so I stuck with it. I had a lot of things to think about, for example: 
  | when I would finish this project
  || how much time I would need to put into it
  ||| and what my final outcome would look like.

### What did I Want to Achieve?

  My drive for my PLEx Project was to be able to make an interactive software which would teach others about computers. The entire purpose of this was to teach others around me (in my community) about computers, where they started, how much they've evolved, and where we are headed. I had a lot of thinking to do, since making computer programs work efficiently with no issue is a bit of a challenge. So, that was osmething I needed to work on.

### How Did I Overcome the Various Obstacles I Encountered?

  Over the period of my PLEx project, I encountered several obstacles. A rather significant obstacle I encountered was learning how to code in JavaScript. Though my project has more than JavaScript for functionality, it was still something that I had to take time to learn. 
A lot of the obstacles I faced had to do with debugging my code. Almost all the time, my code had an error somewhere which interferes with it running, and having to trace back and try to fix that was something that was of difficulty. 
An example of an undetected error in my code: ![thing.png](src)

The faulty I made here was that I used the ‘return’ keyword inside an ‘if’ statement which is at the top. The ‘return’ keyword can only be used inside a function statement ( function() ) 

Here's an example of proper use of 'return': ![hah.png](src)

This, I later fixed by simply removing the ‘return false’ & ‘return true’ statements.
(This is an example of my code when I was still learning.)


As represented, the 'return' keyword can only be used inside a **'function()'** body.

Now, heres an example of my code over this month and a half period:
